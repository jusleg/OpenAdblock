Here is the repo for [Open Adblock](http://openadblock.org) for iOS. This is a simple app that uses content blocking in safari. We want to build the best adblock. In order to do so, it must be free and open source. Any help would be appreciated.

--------------
### To-Do:
 - Setup iTunes Connect
 - Add content filter options

### How to install the app
Since we do not have iTunes connect setup yet, here is how to install the app at the moment. Keep in mind you will have to make a 3.6 GB download.

1. Sign up for the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com).
2. Download Xcode 7 from [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).
3. Install it (and the Developer Tools).
4. Download the zip of this repo
5. Open the zip file and open the OpenAdblock folder, then open OpenAdblock.xcodeproj. This will open it in Xcode.
6. Go to Xcode > Preferences. Open the Accounts tab and add your Apple ID (the one you used to sign to be a developer). Close Preferences.
7. On the right side there will be a sidebar with one file called OpenAdblock. Select it.
8. This will cause a bunch of stuff like Identity, Version, etc. to appear in the center. Select the Team: Unknown Name [Some garbage here] and change it to your account.
9. Plug in your iPhone, and click the iPhone 6 next to the stop button on the top and select your iOS device (not the model, the name of your device).
10. Click the play button, unlock your iPhone, and enjoy :)
